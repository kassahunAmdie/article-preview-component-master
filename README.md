## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

New thing I included here is the use of 'sass'. I have lightly dabbled with it in the past but this time I delved deeper into learning and implementing it. Resources I used are https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpTAMP7gD8&t=2s funny coder for a beautiful introduction on how I can benifit from using sass. Then a deeper dive with coder coder's instructional video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=3000s. Finally I went to the source to solidify my understanding at https://sass-lang.com/documentation/.  




### Continued development

I want to continue to work on sass, having seen how much it helps with organizing and working through the styling process. There is still so much I can learn.
